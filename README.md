# Float and Clear: Both Project

## Overview

This project was created to improve my understanding and practical application of the CSS `float` and `clear: both` properties. The main goal was to design a simple webpage layout using **HTML** and **CSS**, where elements like images and text are aligned using these techniques. 

## Project Features

- **Float Left and Right:** The project implements the `float: left;` and `float: right;` properties to align images or content to either side of the webpage.
- **Clear: Both:** This property is applied to ensure that certain elements, like text or containers, clear any floated elements above them, ensuring a clean and structured layout.
- **Minimal HTML and CSS:** The project solely relies on **HTML** for structure and **CSS** for layout, without the use of JavaScript or other libraries.

## Key CSS Concepts Used

1. **float:** Used to position elements (e.g., images or boxes) to the left or right side of the container, allowing inline content to flow around them.
2. **clear:** Ensures that following elements do not wrap around floated content, keeping the layout organized and preventing overlap.


## Example

The core example of the project is a container that holds two images aligned on opposite sides (left and right) with a block of text displayed below them. The `clear: both;` is applied to the text block to ensure it clears the floated images.

## Learning Outcome

This project allowed me to solidify my knowledge of how floats work and when to use the `clear` property to manage layout flow effectively. It provided a solid foundation for understanding older layout methods in CSS and their limitations.
